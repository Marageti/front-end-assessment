# Overview
We would like you to answer a few front-end questions and create a simple game using React. We have provided a basic React application as a starting point. Use this challenge to showcase the depth of your understanding of React.  After you receive this coding challenge we will schedule an interview a few days later where you will be asked a few technical questions and then will have 15-20 minutes to present your solution by sharing your screen and walking through your design process as well as an overview of your code.  These questions and this presentation will be recorded and reviewed by our Engineering managers to determine the next steps in the interview process.

## Code Questions

- What is props spreading and why should you avoid props spreading?


- What are React hooks and why might you use React lifecycle methods instead of them?


- When should you use a third-party library and what criteria should you use to evaluate them?


- If you could, what would you change or add to the React or Typescript frameworks?

## React Coding Challenge: Memory Card GameOverview
In this challenge, you will create a simple Memory Card Game using React. The game will involve flipping cards to find matching pairs. This project should take a few hours to complete and will test your skills in working with React components, state management, event handling, and CSS styling.

### Requirements
- Setup the Project
  - Fork the following repo to your personal github account as a starting point: https://github.com/Marageti/front-end-assessment
  - Initialize the project.
  - Ensure the project runs successfully with npm start.

- Main Components
  - Header: A component that displays the title of the game and a reset button.
  - CardGrid: A component that displays the grid of cards.
  - Card: A component that represents a single card.

- Features
  - Display Cards: Display a grid of cards face down.
  - Flip Card: Allow the user to click on a card to flip it and reveal the image.
  - Match Pairs: If two flipped cards match, keep them face up. If they do not match, flip them back after a short delay.
  - Reset Game: Provide a button to reset the game at any time.

- Styling
  - Use CSS to style the game. Make sure it is responsive and visually appealing.
  - Use different styles for the card front and back, and for matched pairs.

- Personalization
 - Add at least one additional feature to this game unique to you. This can be anything you choose and there is no wrong answer. You can use this feature to showcase a particular skill or something you find interesting, challenging, or helpful in the React language.

- Submission
 - After you have completed the challenge, please send a link to your repo with your solution prior to the interview.  You will be asked to present your solution during the interview and it will be reviewed by our Engineering Managers.

- Notes
  - Feel free to change, or add to, the provided components as needed
